# Distributed Computing Framework
Framework for deploying Hadoop and Spark on a shared cluster within a batch job.

The official repository is hosted on Bitbucket [here](https://bitbucket.org/avapirev/distributed-computing-framework/src/master/).

What is DCF
===========

DCF stands for Distributed data Computing cluster Framework. It is a collection of bash scripts which configure and launch a Hadoop and/or Spark clusters within a batch job (pbs, slurm, sge) on a traditional shared HPC cluster. The current version has been tested on Apache Hadoop 3.2.1 and Spark 3. The various scripts parse through the job environment to define certain Hadoop/Spark requirements, e.g., list of the job hostnames necessary to fire up the clusters. The default configuration assures minimal working environment with respect to the batch job settings. Further Hadoop/Spark cluster parameter configuration and optimization is left to the user. That can be automatically passed down with a flag pointing to the location where the customized config files are. The contents of the latter will be added to the already determined minimal framework configuration.
